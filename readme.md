## Mission Statement

FinePrint is an intelligent Chrome extension developed by Aaron Do and Jiatian He that helps users understand the hidden risks in Terms and Conditions (T&C) agreements. By leveraging OpenAI's large language model, the extension scans and analyzes T&C documents directly from webpages, assigning a risk score and highlighting the most critical clauses such as those related to privacy, hidden fees, or auto-renewals. It features a user-friendly interface with a risk gauge, bullet-point summaries, and the option to view a full report on a separate webpage. The backend, hosted on AWS and integrated with MongoDB, handles API requests and manages data storage, while the frontend extracts content and displays summaries in real time. FinePrint empowers users to make informed decisions before agreeing to legally binding contracts.
